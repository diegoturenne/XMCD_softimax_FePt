# XMCD_softimax_FePt
Takes reconstruction files from ptypy and STXM and performs XMCD on them for analysis

The idea of the project is to compare magnetic images (XMCD) obtained from STXM from those obtained with super resolution using ptychography. 
the reconstructions were done using ptypy separatedly.

there is a notebook that analyses the results of STXM while another does it for the reconstruction ptyr files.
.... I need to work more on this readme ...
